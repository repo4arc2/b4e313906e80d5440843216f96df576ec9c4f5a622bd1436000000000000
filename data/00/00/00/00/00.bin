he offered me a butterscotch.

BARTON: You're sure no one's home, right?

482
00:35:51,458 --> 00:35:52,833
Yes. Relax.

483
00:35:53,458 --> 00:35:54,541
Come on.

484
00:35:55,458 --> 00:35:57,375
Jeez, this is a home?

485
00:35:58,250 --> 00:36:01,833
Yeah. My, uh, great, great, great,
great grandfather built the building.

486
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:05,166
I tried to swing from that very chandelier
and broke my arm.

487
00:36:05,250 --> 00:36:07,625
So, uh, yeah, pretty impressive family,
all the way around.

488
00:36:07,708 --> 00:36:08,708
Wow.

489
00:36:11,250 --> 00:36:12,250
Impressive.

490
00:36:16,416 --> 00:36:17,666
KATE: So, from the home network,

491
00:36:17,750 --> 00:36:20,791
we should be able to get past
the encryption with my mom's password.

492
00:36:22,375 --> 00:36:24,000
Yeah, I'm in the wrong business.

493
00:36:26,833 --> 00:36:28,625
How'd you say Armand was killed?

494
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:31,041
Stabbed with a sword.

495
00:36:33,791 --> 00:36:35,708
BARTON: See if there's anything on Kazi.

496
00:36:36,708 --> 00:36:38,833
KATE: Okay. Let's see.

497
00:36:42,333 --> 00:36:43,333
Here we go.

498
00:36:44,083 --> 00:36:46,541
Okay, what's this company, Sloan Limited?

499
00:36:46,625 --> 00:36:47,958
Kazi is an employee?

500
00:36:48,041 --> 00:36:50,375
BARTON: Wait, Sloan Limited,
that sounds familiar.

501
00:36:50,458 --> 00:36:51,916
You think there's somethin' there?

502
00:36:53,875 --> 00:36:54,916
I don't know.

503
00:36:55,583 --> 00:36:56,708
(DOOR CREAKING)

504
00:36:56,791 --> 00:36:57,916
Maybe.

505
00:36:58,791 --> 00:37:00,916
KATE: Let me see
what I can pull up on Jack.

506
00:37:03,208 --> 00:37:04,208
Crap.

507
00:37:04,291 --> 00:37:06,791
Now there's an embedded
hardware authentication.

508
00:37:09,958 --> 00:37:11,625
And I've just been locked out.

509
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,000
Clint?

510
00:37:24,916 --> 00:37:26,208
JACK: Don't move.
